## Sum of two Complex Numbers
---
### Algorithm

*Step 01* : **Start**\
*Step 02* : **Declare Complex numbers 'a' & 'b'**\
*Step 03* : **Read real part of 'a' as r1**\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**& imaginary part as img1**\
*Step 04* : **Read real part of 'b' as r2**\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**& imaginary part as img2**\
*Step 05* : **Declare Complex number 'c'**\
*Step 06* : **Assign real part of 'c' as r1 + r2**\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;**& imaginary part as img1 + img2**\
*Step 07* : **Print real & imaginary part of Complex number 'c'**\
*Step 08* : **Stop**
