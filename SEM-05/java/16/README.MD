## Volume of Shapes using Method Overloading
---
### Algorithm

*Step 01* : **Start**

*Step 02* : **Create class VolumeOfShapes with three functions, each having same method name, but has different number of arguments**

*Step 03* : **Declare first function, 'volume' which accepts a side of a cube and return volume of cube as side<sup>3</sup>**

*Step 04* : **Declare second function, 'volume' which accepts radius & height of a cylinder and return volume of cylinder as 3.14 * radius<sup>2</sup> * height**

*Step 05* : **Declare third function, 'volume' which accepts length, breadth & height of a rectangular box and return volume as length * breadth * height**

*Step 06* : **Create main class and call function 'volume' and pass values based on the user's choice**

*Step 07* : **Stop**
